## Instructions

There are several tests included in this repository. We will ask you to complete a subset of these. Don't feel like you need to tackle them all, but if you do that's great too.

We know your time is valuable. Try to time box yourself to a couple of hours. Normally we will give you a couple of days to complete your tasks and we ask you submit them to your point of contact before your next assessment.

If you have any questions about the test or the hiring process, please reach out. 

Thanks again for your interest!
